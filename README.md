- **Repository-based Grouping**: Issues are automatically grouped by repository and sorted alphabetically
- **Real-time Issue Details**: View issue descriptions and labels without leaving the dashboard
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts seamlessly from mobile to large desktop displays
- **Quick Access**: Direct links to GitHub issues and repository views
- **Smart Caching**: Session-based caching to handle API rate limits efficiently

## Live Demo

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- A GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
- Your GitHub username

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-issues-viewer.git
   cd github-issues-viewer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building and Deploying

To deploy this application to your own web server:

1. Create a production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a `dist` directory containing optimized static files.

2. Upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your web server using your preferred method (FTP, SCP, rsync, etc.):

### Authentication

This app requires a GitHub Classic Personal Access Token (PAT) to function. Follow these steps to create one:

1. Go to GitHub Settings > **Developer Settings > [Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) > Tokens (classic)**
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Give your token a descriptive name
4. For scopes, select:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     This is required to access both public and private repository issues
5. Click **Generate token**
6. Copy your token immediately - you won't be able to see it again!

**Important**: Keep your token secure and never commit it to version control. The app stores it locally and only uses it to make authenticated requests to GitHub's API.

On the login screen:

- Enter your GitHub username
- Enter your Personal Access Token
- Click **Login**
